# Clicky Game

## Overview

Clicky React Game is a fun dive in to react.js front-end functionality and stateful components where the player clicks on an image on the page, and the images reshuffle on click. The goal of the game is to avoid clicking the same picture twice. If a user clicks an image that has not already been clicked, they gain one point. If they click an image that has already been clicked, they lose the game and the game resets.
